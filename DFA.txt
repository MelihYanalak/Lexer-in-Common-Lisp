This file is written to explain the structure of DFA

TERMINALS:
	KEYWORD
	IDENTIFIER
	OPERATOR
	VALUE

If the input is alphabetic -> identifier -> if the next input is alphanumeric -> identifier (until else input) -> before accept check if it is KW

					 -> if the next input is something else -> error

If the input is numeric -> value -> if the input is 0 -> value -> next input -> error
				 -> if the input is 1-9 -> the next input is numeric -> value

if the input is ; -> isComment? -> next input is ; too -> comment
		                -> next input is something else -> error
If the input is operator -> for +,-,/ -> next input should not be alphanumeric
			-> for * -> mult -> next input is * too -> doublemult
					 -> else -> error
			-> for paranthesis there is no rule put it directly
